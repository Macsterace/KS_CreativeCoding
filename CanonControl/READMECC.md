A system ws created in which a Canon dslr was controlled wirelessly through turing on a flashlight.  The camera is placed in a dark room while a light sensor is detecting the amount of light.  Once the light passes a certain threshold, the image begins to take and continues until you turn your light off.  This system allows the user to draw with light.  An ardiuno sensor is communicating with openframeworks to detect the amount of light in the room. 

Once the system is plugged in, adjust the threshold to the appropriate level and begin creating.
