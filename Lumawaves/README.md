Lumawaves


Lines are generated as they move shift outward from the center point.  As the hue is rotated through the different line movements, a wave of color is created.  The lines move outward and eventually off-screen until they are reinitialized to the middle of the screen.  The slight differences between each layer of lines drawn creates waves of color across the screen.  Color was the main inspiration behind the project.  The pieces experiments with how a simple change in color can create dynamic gradients across the generated pieces.  

Once the app is run the piece will instantly begin generating, user controls consist of mouse clicks and space bar presses.  The space bar will regenerate the lines begging from the center while the mouse click will draw the background.  Through holding down the mouse the background will constantly be drawn and will show the shape of the lines being generated.  With only space bar presses the lines are reinitialized but the background is not being redrawn so it can get cluster at times.  Added functionality to use the GUI slider.  Viewers now have controls to effect the patch in real time.  The background can be redrawn similar to a mouse press.  The piece can be reinitialized similar to that of a space bar press, the lines can be drawn in reverse but note that the lines will not regenerate with this setting turned on,  a fade toggle was added so the lines slowly fade away allowing for newly generated lines to be more prominent, as well as control to set the line width and the amount of space inbetween lines, the last two toggles have the ability to drastically alter the generated outcome.
