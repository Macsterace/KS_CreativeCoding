Project 1
Lumawaves


Lines are generated as they move shift outward from the center point.  As the hue is rotated through the different line movements, a wave of color is created.  The lines move outward and eventually off-screen until they are reinitialized to the middle of the screen.  The slight differences between each layer of lines drawn creates waves of color across the screen.  Color was the main inspiration behind the project.  The pieces experiments with how a simple change in color can create dynamic gradients across the generated pieces.  

Once the app is run the piece will instantly begin generating, user controls consist of mouse clicks and space bar presses.  The space bar will regenerate the lines begging from the center while the mouse click will draw the background.  Through holding down the mouse the background will constantly be drawn and will show the shape of the lines being generated.  With only space bar presses the lines are reinitialized but the background is not being redrawn so it can get cluster at times
